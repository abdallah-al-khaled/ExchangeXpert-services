      "   Description: US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are looking to recover after mixed economic data and cooling in August's jobs print last week triggered a sell-off. Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan joins Wealth! to break down the outlook for equities and how investors can best navigate the current state of the market. \"Stocks certainly are not in the bargain bin yet... I can't argue for that at all because we're at elevated valuations still at this point from the S&P 500 as a whole. And we're still up over in the double digits for the year so far, even though we've come down here a little bit,\" Bryan says of the most recent pullback. For investors looking to get into the defense sector, he points to stocks like Northrop Grumman (NOC), L3Harris (LHX), and the RTX Corporation (RTX). He argues, \"Those companies are at reasonable valuations already... they have different trajectories and they should be OK given the current environment.\" When it comes to investing in chip stocks, Bryan encourages investors to examine their portfolios and weigh the risks they're willing to take. \"I'm not saying the AI stocks are bad. In fact, we own plenty of them here, but we don't own them to the extent that even the S&P 500 has them. We're underweight Nvidia (NVDA). We're underweight Apple (AAPL),\" he explains. He notes that now may be a good time for investors to take profits from their overexposed positions and reinvest in other areas of the market.

      "   Description: Rafe Jadrosich, the senior home builders and building products analyst at Bank of America Securities, joins Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss the uptick in new residential construction as mortgage rates trend down and the Federal Reserve cuts rates. “From the beginning of July to today, we've seen mortgage rates fall from around 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage down to almost 6.1%. That's a really sharp decline in a short period of time, which is driving the increase in the refinancing activity, and we're almost at the lowest mortgage rate in over two years,” Jadresic tells Yahoo Finance. As mortgage rates fall, there’s been an increase in demand for new homes, and Jadrosich expects the market will “start to get a little bit more activity on the existing home sales side.” “There has been an uptick in inventory,” which is “part of the process for existing home sales to uptick, so we still have a lock-in effect, but definitely, as you're going forward here, it's gotten a little bit better.” Jadresic says “there's sort of a story of two different housing markets, right now, you have the resale market, the existing home market, and then you have the new home market. There's a really interesting dynamic in pricing where existing home prices are actually above new home prices,” which the analyst credits to the “dynamic of supply.” As “home builders are adding supply to the market,” existing homeowners that are locked in at an attractive rate “want to be compensated for giving up their rate.” “Lower rates will help solve the affordability problem just because financing costs are lower, although prices probably tick up a little bit,” Jadrosich outlining that “obviously lower rates will support pricing,” but \"we just need more inventory on the market as well.” Jadrosich names NVR (NVR) and D.R. Horton (DHI) as homebuilder stocks to watch. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n",

      "   Description: Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel joins Market Domination to discuss the best energy plays and how oil commodities (CL=F, BZ=F) may be affected by Hurricane Francine. Thummel is bullish on energy infrastructure, explaining that it has performed \"really well\" this year while still trading at a discount relative to its historical valuation. He points to names like Williams Companies (WMB), Oneok (OKE), and Targa Resources (TRGP) as examples, noting they \"still have a lot of room to run\" and will offer investors a 4 to 5% dividend yield that will only grow. He notes that Energy Transfer (ET) offers about an 8% dividend yield and predicts it to grow between 3% and 5%. He argues that these energy companies \"generate steady, consistent earnings,\" adding, \"then they convert those earnings into cash and then turn around and pay that cash back to the shareholder in the form of higher dividends and stock buybacks.\" As Hurricane Francine barrels toward Louisiana, Thummel notes that 48% of US refining capacity exists on the Gulf Coast. However, the hurricane shouldn't be too much cause for concern as it appears to be moving further east. He notes that refinery operations in Baton Rouge will likely have to either shut down or reduce production temporarily, but other refineries should be able to operate as normal. \"Keep in mind, this is not the first hurricane, obviously, that these energy companies have gone through. They've done a really good job. Management teams have done a really good job of making their assets more hurricane-resistant. And so that's really benefiting all of us because we don't have to worry about these long disruptions that cause significant price hikes... during the hurricane season itself.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "   Description: It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. \"What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\" he says, \"and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \"I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \"good old fashioned names\" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \"It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

      "   Description: Major bank stocks took a hit in Tuesday's trading session after Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr announced updated capital requirement regulations. KBW managing director David Konrad joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the state of the sector and break down the Fed's latest move. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) President and COO Daniel Pinto believes that analysts may have too rosy of expectations for the bank's net interest income expenses in 2025. Konrad notes that his estimate is below Wall Street's own guidance, and adds, \"What happened this past year is their guidance kept being raised because they're asset sensitive, the forward curve didn't materialize, and the Fed really didn't cut rates yet obviously this year. So their estimates this year beat expectations.\" As the Federal Reserve moves into an interest rate easing cycle, Konrad expects \"asset-sensitive\" names like JPMorgan to experience some pressure in its net interest income. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) announced that trading revenue could fall 10% in the third quarter, which Konrad calls \"disappointing.\" He notes that trading will be a more volatile number as it faces seasonality and volume issues. He adds, \"We think that's that's a little bit not necessarily a trend line, but a tough quarter there.\" With the Fed unveiling new proposed capital requirements, Konrad argues that \"reducing the capital requirements by 50% was kind of in the market a little bit. And that's really basically where it came into.\" Fed Vice Chair of Supervision Barr expects capital to rise about 9%, which Konrad says \"feels about right\" and comes in \"largely in-line\" with expectations: \"The Fed typically gold plates the international standards, and then they took it a step further with this proposal. So what ended up happening is you had the US banks holding a lot more capital than the global banks. And so I think this largely adjusts that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.

      "   Description: Rafe Jadrosich, the senior home builders and building products analyst at Bank of America Securities, joins Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss the uptick in new residential construction as mortgage rates trend down and the Federal Reserve cuts rates. “From the beginning of July to today, we've seen mortgage rates fall from around 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage down to almost 6.1%. That's a really sharp decline in a short period of time, which is driving the increase in the refinancing activity, and we're almost at the lowest mortgage rate in over two years,” Jadresic tells Yahoo Finance. As mortgage rates fall, there’s been an increase in demand for new homes, and Jadrosich expects the market will “start to get a little bit more activity on the existing home sales side.” “There has been an uptick in inventory,” which is “part of the process for existing home sales to uptick, so we still have a lock-in effect, but definitely, as you're going forward here, it's gotten a little bit better.” Jadresic says “there's sort of a story of two different housing markets, right now, you have the resale market, the existing home market, and then you have the new home market. There's a really interesting dynamic in pricing where existing home prices are actually above new home prices,” which the analyst credits to the “dynamic of supply.” As “home builders are adding supply to the market,” existing homeowners that are locked in at an attractive rate “want to be compensated for giving up their rate.” “Lower rates will help solve the affordability problem just because financing costs are lower, although prices probably tick up a little bit,” Jadrosich outlining that “obviously lower rates will support pricing,” but \"we just need more inventory on the market as well.” Jadrosich names NVR (NVR) and D.R. Horton (DHI) as homebuilder stocks to watch. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n",

      "   Description: On today's episode of Market Domination Overtime, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton analyze the market close and discuss some of the biggest stories from the trading day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed above its flatline on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) stumbled in the trading session. Overall, the three market indexes capped off another week of gains on their five-day moving averages following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates. Lazard chief market strategist Ron Temple argues that the market is \"well positioned to continue to gain ground over the long term and the intermediate term.\" He believes that the Fed's 50-basis-point cut \"effectively bought an insurance policy against excessive weakening in the labor market.\" He continues, \"Now you combine that with a strong corporate sector, a strong household sector, good corporate earnings, this is a market that can continue to work.\" A new Wall Street Journal report notes that Qualcomm (QCOM) approached Intel (INTC) about a possible takeover. Futurum Group chief market strategist Cory Johnson explains, “This would be the biggest deal in the history of the semiconductor industry, ever.” As the election lies just a month and a half away, Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman discusses how voters are weighing Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump's contrasting economic agendas. Newman notes that Harris and Trump are polling neck-and-neck when it comes to handling the economy. He explains that the economy used to be one of Trump's biggest advantages over President Biden, and since he exited the race, Harris has \"completely neutralized\" the advantage. Friday’s market close marked the end of a “triple witching” session where $5.1 trillion in stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options expire simultaneously. EToro US investment and options analyst Bret Kenwell tells Yahoo Finance, “Today was one of the four big expiration dates of the year when it comes to the options market, and you saw that action leading up to today's session with so much back and forth.\"&nbsp; Finally, Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down what to watch next week, from Fed commentary to August's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data.

      "   Description: Amid reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) approached Intel (INTC) about a possible takeover, Futurum Group chief market strategist Cory Johnson sits down with Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman on Market Domination to take a closer look at what a potential acquisition would mean for the two chip companies. “This would be the biggest deal in the history of the semiconductor industry, ever,” Johnson says, explaining, “Intel was once the largest semiconductor company in the world. It is no longer… They are still very much wedded to selling chips into PCs because their business is selling chips into the data center has just not worked out. They've missed so many product cycles with Nvidia (NVDA) cleaning their clocks in the data center, and that shows no sign of any immediate change.” Johnson notes that Intel’s recently announced deal with Amazon Web Services (AMZN) could give some hope that “they're going to be able to get some of their semiconductor manufacturing business into a better place as they build out facilities all around the world, and especially in the US.” Looking at how a merger would complement Qualcomm’s and Intel’s respective portfolios, Johnson says “Intel [has] things that Qualcomm really doesn't have.\" \"It's got manufacturing prowess; it's got a place in data centers and in PCs. Qualcomm has some plans around PCs, but Qualcomm is largely a smartphone company. Most of their business is making chips for smartphones…. that is something that Intel's famously missed out on for decades now,\" he says. If Qualcomm were to take over Intel, it could fundamentally change the company’s business as “historically [Qualcomm] has not made their own chips.” An acquisition would have to be approved by regulators, but the strategist believes in this instance, national security interests may trump antitrust concerns: “We really need a strong chip industry in this country to fight against the risk of the concentration we have in Taiwan. And something that would help Intel survive and do better, which this merger might be seen as might be welcomed by Washington.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

      "11. Headline: A potential Qualcomm takeover of Intel 'makes sense': Analyst\n",
      "   Description: The Wall Street Journal has reported that Qualcomm (QCOM) has approached Intel (INTC) about a potential takeover. Bob O'Donnell, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, joins Market Domination to break down the news and what it could mean for the struggling chip designer. \"It would be an enormous change. I do think in the current regulatory environment, it's going to be very difficult for Qualcomm to pull it off. I mean, there is a certain logic to it... Obviously, Qualcomm is this very successful US-based chip designer. Intel's got their own business. They have had a lot of challenges...\" O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance. \"It's not surprising to me that we've seen some people, potential suitors, come out and say, 'Hey, this looks like a great opportunity because I still believe in the long run, Intel has got a lot of opportunity.'\" He explains that the move makes \"a lot of sense\" since Intel and Qualcomm's products do not have significant overlap. \"They have complementary types of products. Some of their products compete, for example, in PCs, but they could be seen as complementary offerings,\" he says. Overall, he sees regulatory issues becoming more of a concern than product offerings. If Qualcomm were to buy a portion of Intel's business, O'Donnell believes it would likely have its eye on the existing chip business, since it does not have much experience in the foundry. He adds, \"My initial thought is they're going to go for the products. But you know, part of the challenge that Intel is facing is that that foundry business has to stay alive. It's too important to fail from a US manufacturing and tech competitiveness perspective. And it's not clear that right now it's got enough on its own.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "   Description: US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are looking to recover after mixed economic data and cooling in August's jobs print last week triggered a sell-off. Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan joins Wealth! to break down the outlook for equities and how investors can best navigate the current state of the market. \"Stocks certainly are not in the bargain bin yet... I can't argue for that at all because we're at elevated valuations still at this point from the S&P 500 as a whole. And we're still up over in the double digits for the year so far, even though we've come down here a little bit,\" Bryan says of the most recent pullback. For investors looking to get into the defense sector, he points to stocks like Northrop Grumman (NOC), L3Harris (LHX), and the RTX Corporation (RTX). He argues, \"Those companies are at reasonable valuations already... they have different trajectories and they should be OK given the current environment.\" When it comes to investing in chip stocks, Bryan encourages investors to examine their portfolios and weigh the risks they're willing to take. \"I'm not saying the AI stocks are bad. In fact, we own plenty of them here, but we don't own them to the extent that even the S&P 500 has them. We're underweight Nvidia (NVDA). We're underweight Apple (AAPL),\" he explains. He notes that now may be a good time for investors to take profits from their overexposed positions and reinvest in other areas of the market.

      "   Description: BMO Capital Markets managing director of biopharma equity research Evan Seigerman joins Market Domination to discuss the best biotech plays outside of the GLP-1 weight-loss space. The sky-high demand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has led the biotech sector to reach new heights over the last year, and Seigerman believes the trend is as \"hot as ever.\" He notes that the 2024 European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting revealed key data highlighting the importance of these weight-loss drugs, and he believes that players like Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) continue to lead the industry's growth. However, he sees opportunities outside of the GLP-1 landscape, pointing specifically to Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX) as prime examples. Vertex, a leader in cystic fibrosis research, makes up about $10 billion of its core franchise. The company is on track for early 2025 approval of its next-generation cystic fibrosis treatment as well as a non-opioid, non-addictive pain medication. In addition, Vertex has partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and received approval for Casgevy, a cell therapy treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Seigerman notes that the uptake has been slow as it requires patients to be in the hospital for at least a month as they go through the process. However, he explains that the therapy works and is \"really transformational\" for patients. While Seigerman is bullish on Vertex, he notes that the stock's price is rather high, trading in the upper $400s. The other risk he highlights is a non-opioid paid medication competitor coming to market.

CFRA analyst Zachary Warring joins Morning Brief to weigh in on the mixed picture of the consumer and discuss the retailers performing best in this environment. \"We think the consumer's just being pickier. It's a stable consumer, but we wouldn't say they're strong by any means,\" Warring tells Yahoo Finance. As consumers increasingly prioritize value, Warring notes that off-price retailers are among the companies best positioned to benefit. He points to TJ Maxx (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) as examples, explaining that they continue to see share price appreciation as well as earnings and store growth. However, he notes that there are opportunities outside of value retailers, highlighting Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) as an example as its most recent earnings report demonstrated its ability to grow revenue and expand margins.

      "1. Headline: Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?\n",
      "   Description: It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. \"What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\" he says, \"and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \"I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \"good old fashioned names\" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \"It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

The company, commonly known as Smucker, has acquired many businesses over the years, especially from the late 1990s to the mid-2010s. Smucker’s portfolio now includes major brands, like Jif peanut butter and Uncrustables, spanning categories from coffee to pet food and competing with consumer packaged goods giants, like Nestlé (NSRGY), General Mills (GIS) and Kraft-Heinz (KHC). In 2016 Mark Smucker took over as CEO of the family business. In 2023, he expanded the company’s offerings further with the $5.6B acquisition of Hostess. Despite more consumers wanting to eat healthier, Smucker saw enough runway with the sweet treat brand, as its revenue was trending higher prior to the acquisition. Smucker explains the steps the business has taken to listen to make foods healthier across the board, but he also thinks some of it is up to the consumer. “I think we have to give the consumer choice,” says Smucker.

      "   Description: Before the turn of the 20th century, the J.M. Smucker Company (SJM) was founded as a small apple cider and butter business. 127 years later, The J.M. Smucker Company, commonly known as Smucker, has vastly expanded its business beyond mashed fruits, reaching a value of nearly $13B and operating well known brands in market segments from coffee to pet food. The business now competes with consumer packaged goods giants like Kraft-Heinz (KHC), Nestlé (NSRGY), and General Mills (GIS). One thing has remained consistent since the company’s founding—it’s still led by a Smucker: J.M.’s great, great grandson, Mark. Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith traveled to Orrville, Ohio, the home and origin of Smucker, to get an inside look at how the fifth generation CEO is leading the historic brand and setting up for the next 127 years. Mark Smucker took over in 2016. His biggest move to date came in 2023 when the company acquired the sweet snacks giant, Hostess for $5.6B. Smucker’s decision to expand its portfolio follows a relatively proven company recipe over recent years. Some other Smucker acquisitions include Jif peanut butter and Crisco in 2002, Pillsbury and other brands part of International Multifoods in 2004, Folgers in 2008, Café Bustelo in 2010, and Big Heart Pet Brands in 2015. J.M. Smucker Co. has since sold off the Crisco and International Multifoods businesses. Smucker has also made his mark on the business by leaning into edgier marketing campaigns for many legacy brands, like Jif and Folgers. He has also capitalized on pop culture influence to grow brands, including the popular Uncrustables snack, which the company believes will become a $1B brand in 2026.

The company has only ever been led by a CEO with the last name Smucker, including its current CEO, Mark Smucker—Jerome Monroe’s great-great grandson. Smucker took over in 2016, coming off a stretch where the company multiplied and diversified its business model, largely through the acquisition of major brands like Jif and Folgers. Now competing for shelf space against other major consumer packaged goods companies like Nestlé (NSRGY), General Mills (GIS), and Kraft-Heinz (KHC), Smucker is following a similar playbook, acquiring sweet-baked snacks giant Hostess for $5.6B in 2023. Smucker sat down with Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith in Smucker’s home town of Orrville, Ohio, to share how he deals with the pressure of leading an American institution that is also his family’s 127-year-old business.

The company has pending mergers with US Cellular, Metronet, and Lumos. Sievert outlines how each brand “has a different story” that compliments T-Mobile’s portfolio. T-Mobile announced a deal with OpenAI as it integrates AI tech into its customer support systems: “Our job is to figure out, first and foremost, how do we prevent the need for you to call us in the first place. Every time you finally have to call us, something's gone wrong. We haven't predicted your intentions correctly. And so IntentCX, which is the model we're creating with OpenAI, is all about using the vast amount of data at our fingertips to curate an experience for you at T-Mobile that makes your experience successful so you don't have problems in the first place.\" Sievert forecasts a 75% reduction in \"calls offered to our human agents at our stores and in our care centers, but those remaining 25% will be some of the gnarliest ones and so it will require a higher level of expertise\" and human engagement. The CEO also sheds some light on demand for Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone 16 and comments on the economic environment after the Federal Reserve opted to cut interest rates in September.

Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Equity Research Michael Pachter points out that in Microsoft's case, these jobs are redundant, stemming from its acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. As for the broader industry, he said hiring increased during the pandemic when people were at home playing video games. Now, these companies are \"right-sizing,\" though Pachter thinks they may be cutting too many jobs. Pachter also points to a broader shift in the industry, away from one where people buy the game once at a high price to one where there are in-game purchases. As a result, game makers don't need to make as many games to gain revenue and customers are playing existing titles for longer. Watch the video above to hear what Pachter thinks of Sony's (SONY) new PlayStation 5 Pro and why Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) \"has a lot of momentum.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.

The market seems to think the companies’ arguments are convincing, though not enough to be confident that they will win: Capri’s shares have risen about 12% since the hearings began to $38.87, well off the $57-per-share price that Tapestry agreed to pay if the deal goes through.  One of the FTC’s core arguments has been that if Coach and Michael Kors don’t compete head-to-head anymore, then prices for handbags sold for hundreds of dollars rather than thousands—a category it calls “accessible luxury”—will go up, reducing consumer choice.\n",

Carnegie Mellon University associate professor Phil Koopman notes the significance of Waymo advancing its fleet: \"The question is what kind of growing pains they'll have as they start operating in new cities.\" While many investors are bullish on robotaxis, he casts doubt on its sustainability as a business model, explaining, \"I have trouble seeing robotaxis as a business model because it's a cheaper ride hail and the technology is really sophisticated, expensive. It requires a lot of support.\" The Federal Trade Commission has been trying to block Tapestry's (TPR) acquisition of Michael Kors holding company Capri Holdings (CPRI). Pauline Brown, author of \"Aesthetic Intelligence\" and former LVMH (LVMUY) chairman discusses the designer retail market and the FTC's action.

      "11. Headline: Why the FTC faces a 'high hurdle' in Tapestry-Capri challenge\n",
      "   Description: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been trying to block Coach parent Tapestry's (TPR) acquisition of Michael Kors holding company Capri Holdings (CPRI). Pauline Brown, author of \"Aesthetic Intelligence\" and former chair of LVMH North America, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the designer retail market and the FTC's action. Brown argues that the FTC faces a \"high hurdle\" in making its case. She says, \"The trickiest part of their legal argument is that there is a natural market.. for what they are calling accessibly priced luxury handbags. The reality is, I think it's a spectrum.\" Brown thinks that it's \"a feeble argument\" to say that customers will be hurt by higher prices because \"the customers, if they're happy, they'll still come at the right price, for the right designs. And if they're not, they're going to go to another player.\" Brown also discusses the booming resale market for designer goods as some items sell for a lower price in Europe than they do in China, allowing resellers to profit from the gap.

      "   Description: Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel joins Market Domination to discuss the best energy plays and how oil commodities (CL=F, BZ=F) may be affected by Hurricane Francine. Thummel is bullish on energy infrastructure, explaining that it has performed \"really well\" this year while still trading at a discount relative to its historical valuation. He points to names like Williams Companies (WMB), Oneok (OKE), and Targa Resources (TRGP) as examples, noting they \"still have a lot of room to run\" and will offer investors a 4 to 5% dividend yield that will only grow. He notes that Energy Transfer (ET) offers about an 8% dividend yield and predicts it to grow between 3% and 5%. He argues that these energy companies \"generate steady, consistent earnings,\" adding, \"then they convert those earnings into cash and then turn around and pay that cash back to the shareholder in the form of higher dividends and stock buybacks.\" As Hurricane Francine barrels toward Louisiana, Thummel notes that 48% of US refining capacity exists on the Gulf Coast. However, the hurricane shouldn't be too much cause for concern as it appears to be moving further east. He notes that refinery operations in Baton Rouge will likely have to either shut down or reduce production temporarily, but other refineries should be able to operate as normal. \"Keep in mind, this is not the first hurricane, obviously, that these energy companies have gone through. They've done a really good job. Management teams have done a really good job of making their assets more hurricane-resistant. And so that's really benefiting all of us because we don't have to worry about these long disruptions that cause significant price hikes... during the hurricane season itself.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "   Description: US retail sales unexpectedly rose in August, signaling a resilient consumer. Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry joins Josh Lipton for the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye to discuss the best and worst performing retail players. Mulberry views TJX Companies (TJX) — the parent of chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods — as a buying opportunity, highlighting its positive growth story. He notes that the company's revenue growth is up 6% year-over-year as its brands capture more of the consumer's wallet share. TJ Maxx and Marshall's, in particular, make up 62% of TJX's revenue, while HomeGoods makes up about 17%. Mulberry believes that TJX has adopted an \"aggressive growth strategy\" as it seeks to open up to 1,300 locations globally. In addition, he points out that the company has great margins, which have increased 0.8% year over year. \"[TJX is] growing revenue faster than the retail sales market but also capturing more of it with better cost controls. This is a very strong story, in our opinion, over the next year or so,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. However, he notes that as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates, there may be some currency headwinds the company will have to face, creating some potential downside risk. Meanwhile, Mulberry is bearish on Target (TGT), explaining that same-store sales are down nearly 4% year over year. \"This is obviously a clear sign of a retailer that's not connecting with consumers in a positive way,\" he explains. The portfolio manager argues that Target has opened a \"two-front war with the big box retailers Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT),\" leading the company to discount 5,000 essential goods. He adds that \"consumers have kind of wobbled in their spending\" at Target as they don't know what to expect price-wise. Mulberry also points to consumer confidence stalling amid heated competition as a further reason investors should stay away from Target. \"Obviously, they had some issues with inventory control coming out of COVID. They've tried to discount a lot of that inventory to keep it moving off of the shelf, but that's opened up again another line of competition. And if the economy does start to smooth out or stall, it's going to be an even more competitive environment for those consumer dollars,\" he explains. However, it's not all bad news for Target. Mulberry explains that the company is \"aware of these obstacles that they need to deal with and they are embarking on a digitization and optimization program that will help control some of these costs and rightsize the inventory.\" Thus, he believes the upside for Target in the near term could be in its approach to cost savings.

      "   Description: Wolfe Research managing director and senior research analyst Emmanuel Rosner joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to examine what a Trump or Harris victory in the 2024 election would mean for the auto industry, particularly for electric vehicle makers. If Vice President Kamala Harris won the race against former President Donald Trump, Rosner makes the case for why it would have a positive effect for EV manufacturers like Tesla (TSLA) given the tax incentives provided to car buyers. “In the case of a Trump victory, I think this is where there's a potential risk for much more disruption” in the auto industry,” the analyst indicates since potential tariffs on vehicles imported from outside the US could benefit traditional American automakers like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). He notes that a second term for former president Donald Trump may not be as negative as previously thought since Trump is now \"better friends\" with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Rosner highlighted that his top stock picks for the industry are actually those in the peripheral auto space, including Autoliv (ALV), Aptiv (APTV), and TE Connectivity (TEL), rather than automakers themselves since the analyst remains cautious about the sector.

      "   Description: US retail sales unexpectedly rose in August, signaling a resilient consumer. Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry joins Josh Lipton for the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye to discuss the best and worst performing retail players. Mulberry views TJX Companies (TJX) — the parent of chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods — as a buying opportunity, highlighting its positive growth story. He notes that the company's revenue growth is up 6% year-over-year as its brands capture more of the consumer's wallet share. TJ Maxx and Marshall's, in particular, make up 62% of TJX's revenue, while HomeGoods makes up about 17%. Mulberry believes that TJX has adopted an \"aggressive growth strategy\" as it seeks to open up to 1,300 locations globally. In addition, he points out that the company has great margins, which have increased 0.8% year over year. \"[TJX is] growing revenue faster than the retail sales market but also capturing more of it with better cost controls. This is a very strong story, in our opinion, over the next year or so,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. However, he notes that as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates, there may be some currency headwinds the company will have to face, creating some potential downside risk. Meanwhile, Mulberry is bearish on Target (TGT), explaining that same-store sales are down nearly 4% year over year. \"This is obviously a clear sign of a retailer that's not connecting with consumers in a positive way,\" he explains. The portfolio manager argues that Target has opened a \"two-front war with the big box retailers Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT),\" leading the company to discount 5,000 essential goods. He adds that \"consumers have kind of wobbled in their spending\" at Target as they don't know what to expect price-wise. Mulberry also points to consumer confidence stalling amid heated competition as a further reason investors should stay away from Target. \"Obviously, they had some issues with inventory control coming out of COVID. They've tried to discount a lot of that inventory to keep it moving off of the shelf, but that's opened up again another line of competition. And if the economy does start to smooth out or stall, it's going to be an even more competitive environment for those consumer dollars,\" he explains. However, it's not all bad news for Target. Mulberry explains that the company is \"aware of these obstacles that they need to deal with and they are embarking on a digitization and optimization program that will help control some of these costs and rightsize the inventory.\" Thus, he believes the upside for Target in the near term could be in its approach to cost savings.

      "   Description: The more earnings that come out from major retail chains, the clearer the picture for US consumers and the broader retail landscape becomes. Though with discount stores reporting consumer spending pullbacks — Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) — is there more turbulence ahead for the retail space? Goldman Sachs Vice President Brooke Roach sits down with Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma at Goldman Sachs' Global Retailing Conference to discuss the current landscape of the consumer, retailers, and more. \"One of the things that we've seen in retail the last couple of quarters is an acceleration of the bifurcating trends in retail between market share winners, such as off-price and other specific brands that have newness and innovation, that are comping quite positively,\" Roach says,\" and a tougher trend in department stores overall, where they've seen negative comp [comparable store sales] trends, they've seen a more cautious outlook on their consumer.\" Roach stresses why \"value\" and \"innovation\" are key themes that pull companies ahead, specifically before the holiday season when promotions will be a driver of consumer traffic. Roach elaborates on the difference between lower and middle-income earning consumers and why certain retail stores are pulling ahead of others: \"It's the middle-income consumer that's seeing a little bit lower growth this year in 2024. As we move into 2025, we actually think that that could get a little bit better across the board. But I think there's a more interesting trend behind what we're seeing between some of these retailers... The companies that are performing the best right now, that are gaining market share regardless of price point or value proposition, are doing it through innovation.\" Roach and DiPalma reference brands such as Nordstrom (JWN), Macy's (M), Lululemon (LULU), Amer Sports (AS), SharkNinja (SN), and TJX Companies (TJX) to underline these points.

CFRA analyst Zachary Warring joins Morning Brief to weigh in on the mixed picture of the consumer and discuss the retailers performing best in this environment. \"We think the consumer's just being pickier. It's a stable consumer, but we wouldn't say they're strong by any means,\" Warring tells Yahoo Finance. As consumers increasingly prioritize value, Warring notes that off-price retailers are among the companies best positioned to benefit. He points to TJ Maxx (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) as examples, explaining that they continue to see share price appreciation as well as earnings and store growth. However, he notes that there are opportunities outside of value retailers, highlighting Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) as an example as its most recent earnings report demonstrated its ability to grow revenue and expand margins.

With that increase, comes defense spending, but which companies can best capitalize on this momentum? Citi managing director, aerospace and defense lead analyst Jason Gursky joins Market Domination to give insight into the defense sector and what investors need to know about the current environment. Gursky explains the defense sector is doing well as governments look to bolster and modernize their defenses as ongoing geopolitical conflicts escalate: \"Military modernization is the way to deter our potential enemies, and that's what we're seeing today. We're seeing rising budgets and the modernization of a lot of military kit.\" He provides one of his lesser known picks for the industry: \"TransDigm (TDG) is a bit more of a commercial aerospace company. They do provide quite a bit of parts that go into the defense industry, but I think most investors like that one because of its exposure to, the airline industry and by those that are buying new aircraft and, and servicing those aircraft. They have also been a serial acquirer rolling up a pretty fragmented industry.\" Watch the video above to hear why Gursky also likes Ducommun (DCO).

      "   Description: Beyond Meat (BYND) CEO Ethan Brown joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss his vision for the future of the company as it focuses on capturing market share and delivering quality products at a reasonable price. Brown explains that his vision for Beyond Meat is for it to be a \"global protein company that rivals, some day, in size JBS (JBSAY) or Tyson (TSN) or these large animal protein.\" He emphasizes that the company is focused on social, health, and environmental factors, and adds, \"our best days are ahead of us.\" Beyond Meat has capitalized on the move away from animal meat in both the US and Europe, garnering praise and endorsements from the health and nutrition communities. Brown specifically highlights how the brand's nuggets and burgers are being offered in McDonald's (MCD) locations across Germany. While Brown sees more traction in Europe when it comes to fast food, he believes that \"our day is not done here in the US.\" He tells Yahoo Finance, \"One of the things that did happen after we went public is a lot of companies came into the category, and they were less choiceful about the ingredients, less choiceful about the health benefits of their products. So as those companies go away and Beyond Meat continues to lead, we're bringing, I think, consumers back.\" He expects to see a consolidation in the industry as a lot of Beyond Meat's competitors start to run low on money. Moving forward, Brown says the company is focused on the most important thing — fundamentals. As the company focuses on lowering its spending, Brown says its debt \"is not something that keeps me up.\" He continues, \"What I'm focused on is continuing to grow the fundamentals of the business. I've become a lean convert. I'm very interested in lean management and lean principles, and that's helping us to strip cost out of our structure.\" \"The promise that we made when we went into the markets is the promise we're going to fulfill, which is there'll be a day when you can have Beyond Meat at a price that is under that of animal protein. Today, the task we have is to make sure consumers understand how healthy this is, how great it tastes. But over time, you'll see us also be able to address pricing globally,\" he adds.

Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an \"instant gratification\" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that \"any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs\" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, \"What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?\" describing this as \"the next leg of opportunity\" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, \"The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.\" Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Glaessgen has a Sell rating on Ulta Beauty (ULTA), noting that the company is facing several external headwinds: \"You've seen massive expansion of distribution in the category with the Sephora and Kohl's (KSS) partnership, and you're also seeing a deceleration. Makeup and beauty performed really well out of COVID, much beyond what most people expected. And so now you're seeing a natural deceleration.\" She notes that these headwinds may not be fully accounted for in the stock price, which influenced her Sell rating. While the economy slows, she explains that beauty companies have been \"really well-valued within the consumer space.\" She highlights the sector's resilient growth, and with younger generations showing increased interest in makeup and skincare, she sees e.l.f Beauty (ELF) in a position to benefit. Glaessgen says that the company has had \"phenomenal growth over the past few years,\" despite currently experiencing a bit of a deceleration. After growing 80% in 2023, she believes e.l.f. is naturally coming off its highs and highlights that the company still expects double-digit growth in the second half of 2024. She also points to e.l.f.'s successful marketing strategy as it has a strong social media presence and knows how to leverage the influencer economy. Meanwhile, Glaessgen is bearish on Estée Lauder (EL), explaining that while it has found success in the Asia-Pacific market, it is experiencing issues in the domestic market. She also notes that its earnings estimates have \"come down pretty meaningfully over the past year,\" and says that it is too early to view it as a buy-the-dip opportunity.

He notes that monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) spending will be \"key\" to a continued tech rally. Kinahan indicates that Nvidia remains a top name among Tastytrade's retail clients. Alongside Nvidia, he highlights that clients also seem bullish on Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and the United Parcel Service (UPS) while there was broad bearishness around Lululemon (LULU), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Disney (DIS).

      "   Description: It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. \"What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\" he says, \"and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \"I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \"good old fashioned names\" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \"It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

      "   Description: It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. \"What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\" he says, \"and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \"I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \"good old fashioned names\" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \"It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

On Monday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest product offerings at its highly anticipated \"It's Glowtime\" event in Cupertino, California. Ng explains that the event \"delivered in line with investor expectations,\" noting that historically, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 70 basis points on announcement days, and following the event, it underperformed by about 100 basis points. \"We think that was in line with historical events. And when you look at the individual product announcements, it came in mostly as expected,\" he adds. Ng reiterates his Buy rating on Apple, arguing that \"there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones.\" He continues, \"We think that investors have historically thought about Apple iPhones at a normalized sell-through rate at about 225 to 230 million units. And we think that AI and some of the new product features that are going to get rolled out over the next few years is going to bring that normalized run rate closer to 250 to 260 million.\" While there is debate among investors as to whether AI will be the demand driver for Apple, Ng is bullish on the technology. He also highlights that hardware changes will also drive an upgrade cycle as screen sizes increase, devices become thinner, and rumors that the iPhone 18 may potentially be foldable. Turning to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Ng believes that the company is managing its video business holistically. \"The linear TV network business is certainly having challenges. Cord cutting is unrelenting, and paid TV subscriber declines will continue to occur. That being said, it's an incredibly cash-generative business and it helps to fund growth investments elsewhere in the Warner Brothers portfolio,\" he explains. He points to momentum in its streaming platform Max, and argues that \"there's a crown jewel in the Warner Brothers film and television studio.\" Meanwhile, Ng believes that one of Disney's (DIS) biggest challenges will be its succession planning. Investors have praised the company's growth under CEO Bob Iger, and Ng notes that before Iger's return to the company, Disney faced \"a few missteps,\" especially in its film and TV divisions. \"I think there's a tremendous amount of focus on what that succession planning looks like. One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios, and obviously at ESPN,\" Ng tells Yahoo Finance.

Giving a summary of this summer, Pandya says: \"We're technically down from last year, which sounds bad, but however May was the biggest reason for that. May was down versus last year because we didn't have the biggest movies because of the strikes last year.\" He continues with: \"But once we got the adrenaline going, that's the beginning of June. It's been gangbusters in June, July and August. So we are up big right now during this current period with two movies breaking $600 million each.\" When asked if the industry has bounced back since the Covid shutdowns, Pandya gives states: \"We're not at the pre-pandemic level, but I think that what we've seen this summer is a good sign for the future, and it's all across different genres. So we were firing on all cylinders this summer. Animation was hot. Superheroes, action, horror was doing well, even romance doing well. Sci fi. So all the different genres are working.

And actually, they're making more money for those tiers that have ads. And so we're forecasting for, by the time we get to the end of this year, there'll be roughly $6 billion of advertising on these streaming services. And I'm talking about Disney (DIS) and Hulu and Netflix (NFLX). And within three years, it's going to be $15 billion.\" He believes that moving forward, ad tiers will end up being bigger than non-ad tiers because they are a better deal for consumers and it is ultimately more profitable for streaming companies.

      "   Description: Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel joins Market Domination to discuss the best energy plays and how oil commodities (CL=F, BZ=F) may be affected by Hurricane Francine. Thummel is bullish on energy infrastructure, explaining that it has performed \"really well\" this year while still trading at a discount relative to its historical valuation. He points to names like Williams Companies (WMB), Oneok (OKE), and Targa Resources (TRGP) as examples, noting they \"still have a lot of room to run\" and will offer investors a 4 to 5% dividend yield that will only grow. He notes that Energy Transfer (ET) offers about an 8% dividend yield and predicts it to grow between 3% and 5%. He argues that these energy companies \"generate steady, consistent earnings,\" adding, \"then they convert those earnings into cash and then turn around and pay that cash back to the shareholder in the form of higher dividends and stock buybacks.\" As Hurricane Francine barrels toward Louisiana, Thummel notes that 48% of US refining capacity exists on the Gulf Coast. However, the hurricane shouldn't be too much cause for concern as it appears to be moving further east. He notes that refinery operations in Baton Rouge will likely have to either shut down or reduce production temporarily, but other refineries should be able to operate as normal. \"Keep in mind, this is not the first hurricane, obviously, that these energy companies have gone through. They've done a really good job. Management teams have done a really good job of making their assets more hurricane-resistant. And so that's really benefiting all of us because we don't have to worry about these long disruptions that cause significant price hikes... during the hurricane season itself.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) \"had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed.” “Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead.” “Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.” He says, “Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs.” “I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment.” He says “the cooling down of investment” could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. “If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

      "   Description: Intel stock climbs as Apollo Global Management (APO), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, reportedly offered a multibillion-dollar investment. That came after reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) approached Intel with a buyout offer. Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst, joins Morning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith to discuss the legacy chipmaker’s position amid reported takeover and investment opportunities. Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance he has “a hard time seeing that deal work, especially if the fabs are included, and the issue is that they're losing a lot of money right now.” A fab is a semiconductor fabrication facility, a factory that makes chips. “Qualcomm would probably have to use a lot of stock. If they did a stock deal, it's significantly dilutive for Qualcomm. It could be 20% or even more dilutive, and the problem is if they start borrowing money and adding cash, the leverage goes up really, really high, really, really quickly.” The analyst says, “I have a really hard time seeing it work with the fabs. I'm not sure that they could do a deal without the fabs,” as, in his view, they couldn’t spin off their fab businesses into independent companies, but they can’t scrap them. “I don't think that that's politically viable at this point,” as the US prioritizes its position in the global chip market. He adds, “I'd rather not see Qualcomm do a deal like this. I think it's hard to do a deal where I think the risk would justify the returns on this. We'll see if they can construct something. But I don't really like it. So I'm hoping we don't have something like this.” Regarding the potential Apollo investment, Rasgon highlights that Apollo has an existing relationship with Intel. The analyst says that while neither party has confirmed the reports that Apollo could invest up to $5 billion in Intel, the story could be viewed as “a vote of confidence” in the company. Rasgon says the regulatory side of a potential Qualcomm takeover is “really tough,” though he notes in the US it “could be easier” as its “a US national champion buying a national champion.” He says, “There are very few areas where Qualcomm and Intel really overlap,” with the auto space being one. He explains that Intel and Qualcomm have likely discussed Intel divesting from Mobileye (MBLY) if there is a takeover.

      "1. Headline: Amazon's ad opportunity is its 'so-what' factor: Analyst\n",
      "   Description: Evercore ISI managing director and head of internet research Mark Mahaney joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to take a look at big tech stocks after the Federal Reserve kicked off its rate-cutting cycle with a focus on Amazon (AMZN) and its advertising opportunities. The Fed’s rate cuts create “a benign environment for a megacap tech stocks…If we replay the tape over the last two years, the beginning of 2022 was a terrible period for tech stocks, for long-duration assets, and because we went from zero to 100 or from 0% to 5% in terms of interest rates, [an] unprecedented spike in interest rates, and it really crushed the tech sector.” “We've had this pretty material outperformance in tech stocks, and now that the rates are starting to come down, that should help as well. I think a lot of this is anticipated into the stocks, but still a declining rate environment is generally good for long-duration assets like tech.” The analyst lifted his price target for Amazon, highlighting the “so-what” factor for Amazon going forward is its Amazon Prime advertising opportunity. “Amazon is so big as a company. It's kind of hard to hit a lot of home runs from here. It's all singles, really, but this is a good single.” “The company does about $50 billion a year in ad revenue. It's actually the third largest ad platform in the world and there's a lot of still unmonetized or lightly monetized areas [like] Amazon Prime Video… it's a great opportunity for Amazon to scale up another revenue stream.\" “The ‘so what’ of this is it's going to allow Amazon's ad revenue growth rate, which has been around 20%, to accelerate going into next year, and then this is very high margin business…anything to boost the growth rates for either cloud or advertising is good for the business overall.” He says, “I call it the best mix shift story in tech, i.e., the fastest growing assets have the highest margins. It's good for Amazon's margins too.” The analyst discusses the “big bet that the company has made on live sports” with Thursday Night Football…“There's just a lot more live sports content that's on Amazon and I think that's going to be one of the biggest investment areas for the company over the next three to five years, and you can monetize that.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.
